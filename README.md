# Hangman Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic game "Hangman" in OOP. The game randomly selects a word from a list of possible words, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of guesses, represented by the number of "lives" they have. If they guess a letter that is not in the word, they lose a life. If they guess a letter that is in the word, the letter is revealed in the word. The game is won when the player guesses all the letters in the word before running out of lives.

## Installation

To run the game, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python 3 installed, simply download the `hangman.py` file and run it using the Python interpreter.

## Usage

To play the game, run the `main.py` file in a Python interpreter. The game will display a prompt asking for a letter. Enter a letter and press Enter to make a guess. The game will continue until the player has guessed all the letters in the word or has run out of lives.
